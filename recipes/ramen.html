    <h3>QUICK 30-MINUTE CHICKEN RAMEN</h3>
    <p>Ramen is a type of Japanese noodle soup that's with the main components of flavourful homemade broth and noodles.
        The broth is usually made with bones and cooked for hours, to get that deep umami flavours.
        The noodles are usually handmade.
    </p>
    <p>Having said that, not all of us have the hours to dedicate to, for whenever we crave for a bowl of ramen.
        So this recipe is a quick and simplified way to enjoy ramen at home, while still preserving the essences of ramen, as much as possible.
