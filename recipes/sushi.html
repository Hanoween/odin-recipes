    <h3>Homemade Sushi</h3>
    <p>Homemade Sushi is so much cheaper than at the restaurant.
        Sushi is easy and fun to make at home, and you can put all your favorite ingredients into your perfect custom roll — here’s how!</p>
    <p>I’ll be very honest and say that there’s definitely a reason why chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.
        Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade sushi wins:
        You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seaweed</li>
        <li>Sushi rice</li>
        <li>1/2 lb piece of salmon</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Pickled ginger</li>
        <li>Wasabi</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice and flatten gently with a rice paddle (but do not smash the rice)</li>
        <li>Cut straight down through the filet of the salmon, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip</li>
        <li>Place your desired ingredients onto the rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese</li>
        <li>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces</li>
    </ol>
